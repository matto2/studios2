                        <strong>Hello and thanks for visiting!</strong> ðŸ‘‹ I'm an experience and interaction design professional currently designing enterprise file sharing and collaboration products at Axway. Before that I designed products at Accellion and at FastPencil where I redesigned the cloud-based publishing platform. I have a varied background in designâ€“from founding a surf magazine to running production at creative agencies. Recently I created <a href="http:keeptheapostrophe.com"> keeptheapostrophe.com </a>with my father. See more design & art <a href="http://olearystudios.com/visualdesign.html"> here</a> and occasional writings on UX and other subjects on <a href="https://medium.com/@mattosurf">Medium</a>.
                        <p class="line-height2">My design process involves understanding customer and business goals via discussions and sketching out ideas with product owners. From there I prototype, test and iterate based on feedback. I love discussing and testing with customers. Things I check for: is this useful, usable, understandable, accessible? I collaborate closely with Dev and QA to build and test, then validate production versions with customers. Design isn't done until customers have successful outcomesâ€“getting their jobs done with ease and efficiency.</p>

                At Accellion I redesigned the secure file sharing web application to better support the various jobs customers were visiting the site for. While keeping the ability to share folders, I put more focus back on secure file sharing functions. I also incorporated patterns from web and desktop email applications in order to reduce training and increase a sense of familiarity for new users.
